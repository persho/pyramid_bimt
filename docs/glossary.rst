Definitions of basic terms
==========================

.. glossary::

    IM
        Internet Marketing, advertising and marketing efforts that use the Web
        and email to drive sales.

    JV
        The term refers to a number of Internet Marketers working together in
        order to benefit one another. Each of the marketers involved in the
        joint venture has something unique to contribute in terms of resources
        (someone brings a good product, the other a sizable customer base).
        Bringing these resources together in the form of a joint venture
        provides huge benefits to each of the parties involved in terms of
        exposure, response, profits, and sales.

    JVZoo
        JVZoo is an affiliate partner program or a mini marketplace, where
        internet marketers can search for products to promote or to sell. All
        BIMT products start their public sales life on JVZoo, so we can easily
        get exposure to many potential affiliates. Upon a purchase we receive
        a POST from JVZoo's servers, called :term:`IPN`.

    ClickBank
        Same as :term:`JVZoo`, only bigger and older.

    CB
        Shorthand for :term:`ClickBank`.

    IPN
        A POST request from JVZoo's or ClickBank's servers, notifying us of a
        purchase and giving user's details so we can create a user account in
        the BIMT app.

    WSO
        Short for `Warrior Special Offer` a special offer for members of the
